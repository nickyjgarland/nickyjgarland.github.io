Hello everyone! Here's the first blog post on my very own github supported website. This will be a short one just to acclimate visitors to this newly created personal website. 

On the top bar on the home page you'll see links to the main pages of the website:

1. About me - does what it says on the tin, lots of information about me and my     professional career as an archaeologist.
  
2. Publications - a list of the articles that I have published in the field of archaeology. Wherever possible I've included a DOI to the article/book chapter and many are open access and freely available to download. Other places to look for my research is my Research Gate profile, which is also linked to from this page.
  
3. Presentations - I have given a number of presentations on my research at different academic conferences and public arenas over the last ten years. Here's a list of what I have done so far, which I periodically update. I also try and upload the presentation to my Research Gate profile, so check it out. I have future plans to add a database of the presentations, available via a Creative Commons licence, and a list of my teaching experience at various universities. 
  
Links to my social media and github account can be found along the bottom of the page.

There is more to come - its definitely a work in progress - so please come back and check it out.
